## Fall 2018
- 15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation
- 15-151: Mathematical Foundations for Computer Science (aka Concepts)
- 21-241: Matrices and Linear Transformations
- 76-101: Interpretation and Argument (aka Interp)

Extracurriculars: none

#### Reflection
I took a pretty light course load this semester, as I figured I would need time to find friends, become adjusted to college, and find a couple of clubs I liked. The workload was surprisingly more difficult than I thought it would be, so I spent less time doing the things I mentioned above. For instance, I joined 0 clubs, and found friends at office hours for 15-122 and 15-151. 

Tip (for CMU students): go to office hours, and find friends there! You’ll meet some of the most hardworking and dedicated people, usually while working on problems together, or while waiting on the infamously long queues.

## Spring 2019
- 15-251: Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science
- 15-150: Principles of Functional Programming
- 85-102: Introduction to Psychology
- 80-180: Nature of Language

Extracurriculars: HCI research (with Dr. Afsaneh Doryab), TA for 15-122 (Principles of Imperative Computation)

#### Reflection
The workload ended up being too much for someone who was still adjusting to college. Partially because I was so hung up on other work, I really struggled in 15-251 and 15-150. I got very little sleep, didn’t eat properly, and didn’t stay in touch with friends that I had made in the previous semester. 

That being said, I really enjoyed TAing 15-122. It was the highlight of my semester and I loved going to office hours, lab, and recitation and trying to be the best TA I could be. Also, the research I worked on ended up turning into a soon to be published paper (coming April 2021)! This could not have been done without my research mentor, who was very understanding of the chaos I had put myself into.

## Summer 2019
I relocated to Seattle to participate in the Amazon Future Engineer internship, working under the Content Experience team. Although I figured out that web development wasn’t my thing during the internship, I was blessed with a super supportive team/organization (shoutout to Ohad, Dave, David, Jay, Osai, and Ryan!), and enjoyed the high-impact work I was assigned. 

#### Reflection
I found the workload for my internship pretty reasonable, although I did work extra hours for the first few weeks, since I thought I had to. I ended up completing much more than the expected amount of internship work, but I was able to relax for the last couple of weeks of my internship. 

#### Three Things I Learned
- Ask your coworkers for help! Especially if this is your first work experience, your mentors get that it’s difficult to get adjusted to industry work when you’ve only been in school.
- Although large codebases are very intimidating at first, they are usually easier to understand than you think they are (and if you’re having trouble, see point 1).
- Playing Tetris 99 on a large TV is significantly more fun than playing on a tiny Nintendo Switch screen.

## Fall 2019
- 15-213: Introduction to Computer Systems
- 15-210: Parallel and Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms
- 15-259: Calculus in Three Dimensions
- 33-104: Experimental Physics
- 15-295: Competitive Programming (dropped)

Extracurriculars: TA for 15-122 (Principles of Imperative Computation)

#### Reflection
Although it was still hard, the dreaded 15-213/15-210 combo was not as difficult as I thought it would be. Even if the classes themselves are harder than the ones I took freshman year, the study skills I gained after going through a year of CMU education made me feel much more prepared than I was freshman fall or freshman spring.

This semester was also when I figured out I wanted a computer systems concentration. Finding out what I was interested in within the computer science field was a huge relief. I was the freshman who switched planned minors every week, and to my surprise, my decision of concentration came naturally and gradually. 

Lastly, competitive programming is very difficult without previous experience. 

## Spring 2020
- 15-410: Operating System Design and Implementation (aka OS)
- 15-259: Probability and Computing (aka PnC)
- 80-135: Introduction to Political Philosophy

Extracurriculars: TA for 15-213 (Introduction to Computer Systems)

#### Reflection
As most CMU CS students know, 15-410 is one of the hardest, most time-consuming classes in the entire school of computer science. Taking it in my sophomore spring with limited coding experience was a daring move, but I don’t regret it one bit. I learned a lot of interesting material and debugging resilience from taking OS, and it really increased my confidence as a systems programmer. Intro to Political Philosophy (80-135), taught by Professor Gray, is one of the hidden gems of the CMU class offerings. And as most people who have taken PnC will tell you, Professor Mor Harchol Balter is top tier and PnC is a really high quality class.

My workload this semester was really high, given two hard classes (OS and PnC) with 20 hours per week of TAing, but as stated before, my study and time management skills get better every semester, so in the end, it was manageable!

This was also the semester where I obtained test extensions. With a professor’s help, I realized that my anxiety regarding test taking was way above average, and I’ve definitely messed up a few tests due to mid-test anxiety attacks. The stigma around having mental health problems and learning/test taking accommodations needs to be reduced, and I hope by sharing this small story, I’m doing my part in normalizing the conversation around mental health problems and disabilities.

## Summer 2020
I took a virtual internship offer at AWS Redshift on the Control Plane team, while simultaneously doing course development as a TA for 15-213 and working on finalizing my research paper to send to conferences.

#### Reflection
Overall, this workload was the most I’ve ever taken on (including Spring 2019). I incorrectly assumed that I would be able to be more productive in a completely virtual environment. In fact, I figured out that it goes the other way--online work is very taxing for me.

Despite the online setbacks, my internship was fun, and I learned a lot about systems design, implementation, and measuring software performance. I also made the service I was working on 3x faster! This was also the semester where I learned the most about course development in a university setting. I led the development of new written assignments, helped work on a new programming assignment, co-wrote a proposal regarding staff structure, and developed lecture activity material. 

During the summer, my very positive experience regarding course development and TAing led me to seriously consider attending a PhD program after graduation.

## Fall 2020
- 15-312: Foundations of Programming Languages
- 15-445: Database Systems
- 15-300: Research and Innovation in Computer Science
- 76-210: Banned Books

Extracurriculars: TA for 15-213 (Introduction to Computer Systems), CMU Databases Research Group, CMU CS Education Group

#### Reflection
Taking mostly online classes really did take its toll on me this semester. I found it pretty hard to focus throughout the semester due to online classes and the lack of social interaction with my peers. To make matters worse, both the CS classes I took this semester (15-445 and 15-312) and the class I TAed (15-213) were understaffed, which meant more confusion as a student and more work as a TA to ensure class functionality. However, this does not discount the enormous effort by all professors, TA staff, and students to ensure that school could still run in a semi-okay fashion. 

In terms of classes, all of my classes were well-taught with very enthusiastic professors, but the class that stood out to me most was Banned Books. Professor Newman is absolutely stellar and understands the importance of bringing controversial issues to the classroom discussion space. 

This was also my first semester doing systems research with the CMU Databases Group. Although I’m still learning the ins and outs of being in a systems research group, it’s been fun working on the handmade database, interacting with other researchers in the group, and exploring different career possibilities (mostly the more alluring possibility of grad school).

Although I still learned a lot from my classes and from extracurricular experiences, above all, this semester taught me to appreciate what I had before (such as being able to leave my home to see a friend) and offer compassion to both myself and those around me.
