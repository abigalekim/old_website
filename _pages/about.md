Hello! My name is Abigale Kim and I'm a current junior at Carnegie Mellon University, studying computer science. I'm interested in both computer systems (particularly databases/OS) and CS education. 

Here is a list of things I've been up to since I started college:
- TAed for four semesters and counting! The classes I've TAed/am TAing include 15-122 (Principles of Imperative Computation) and 15-213 (Introduction to Computer Systems).
- For the classes I TAed, I worked on course development, including writing course objectives, working on a new programming assignment, and successfully adding written assignments as lead TA to one of the classes I TAed (15-213).
- Researched patterns between physical, mental, lifestyle, and personality factors in college students and their academic performance (done under Dr. Afsaneh Doryab).
- Interned at Amazon, in the Shopping Foundations organization, and developed a web publishing platform used by 6,000 Amazon content merchandisers. (Summer 2019)
- Co-wrote a Linux-style kernel from scratch in C and x86 assembly machine code. The kernel supports preemptive scheduling, multiple address spaces, and a subset of syscalls.
- Interned at AWS Redshift, and designed/implemented a scalable prewarming service that decreased the cold-start compilation time of Redshift CaaS (Compilation as a Service) by more than 3x. (Summer 2020)
- Joined the CMU DB research group, where I'm just getting started!

Hope you enjoy browsing around my very-incompleted website!
