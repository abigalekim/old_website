Hello! My name is Abigale (Abi) Kim and I am currently a software engineer at [TileDB](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB). I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in December 2021, with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a concentration in Computer Systems. I am interested in both database systems and CS education.

Here is a list of things I've been up to in the past few years:
- TAed for eight semesters in college. The classes I have TAed include 15-122 (Principles of Imperative Computation), 15-213 (Introduction to Computer Systems), and 15-445 (Database Systems).
- Worked on course development, including writing course objectives, working on a new programming assignment, and successfully adding written assignments as lead TA to 15-213.
- Researched patterns between physical, mental, lifestyle, and personality factors in college students and their academic performance (done under Dr. Afsaneh Doryab).
- Interned at Amazon, in the Shopping Foundations organization, and developed a web publishing platform used by 6,000 Amazon content merchandisers. (Summer 2019)
- Co-wrote a Linux-style kernel from scratch in C and x86 assembly machine code. The kernel supports preemptive scheduling, multiple address spaces, and a subset of syscalls.
- Interned at AWS Redshift, and designed/implemented a scalable prewarming service that decreased the cold-start compilation time of Redshift CaaS (Compilation as a Service) by more than 3x. (Summer 2020)
- Joined the CMU DB research group, where I'm working on implementing SQL EXPLAIN and a query key comparator using just in time compilation.
- Joined the CMU CS Education Group, where we meet occassionally to have important discussions on collegiate CS education.
- Interned at Yugabyte, and implemented cluster mapping-update integration during an asynchronous tablet split. This ensures that after a successful consumer tablet split, the DBMS correctly updates the map of producer tablets to consumer tablets. Within the YugabyteDB distributed system, producer tablets are tablets that produce data, and consumer tablets are tablets that replicate the producerâ€™s data.

I hope you enjoy browsing around my website!
