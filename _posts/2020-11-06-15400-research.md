title: A Collection of Updates on My 15-400 Research Project (Spring 2021)
categories: 
---

In the Spring 2021 semester, I'll be researching the implementation of a query key comparator using just in time compilation for [NoisePage](https://noise.page/). I'll be researching this under Professor [Andy Pavlo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/) and PhD student [Prashanth Menon](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~prashanm/).

I'm doing this project as part of the class 15-400, which aims to give computer science research experience to CMU undergraduates. I'll be updating this web page with both assignments for the class and little updates of my own as I learn about computer systems research!

# November 2020
Before I started my project, I first wrote a project proposal. It includes context on my research project and a semester-long plan for project completion.
